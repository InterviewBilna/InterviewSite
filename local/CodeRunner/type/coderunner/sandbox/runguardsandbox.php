/*
 * Provides the RunguardSandbox class, which is a lightweight sandbox that
 * runs jobs using the 'runguard' program that provides the controlled
 * execution environment in the DomJudge programming contest system
 * (see http://www.domjudge.org/).
 * 
 * THIS CLASS IS NOW DEPRECATED - use the Jobe Sandbox instead.
 * 
 * Jobs are run as user 'coderunner' with resource limits set by
 * the language, so is at least safe against major resource depletion issues
 * (memory, CPU). However, it does not protect against system calls like socket,
 * and the program can read any world-readable file on the server.
 *
 * One major concern with the use of RunguardSandbox is concurrency. runguard
 * limits processes using the standard Linux set_resource_limits mechanism,
 * but this limits the processes/threads on a per-user basis not on a per
 * process-tree basis like other resources. In a web-server environment,
 * each user request results in a new server thread and each thread can
 * proceed to do coderunner tests. These all run as user 'coderunner'.
 * Languages like Matlab and Java make extensive use of threads (a typical
 * JVM execution uses at least 10 threads and Matlab uses even more).
 * If too many coderunner instances are active at once, a new submission might
 * fail for no fault of its own. This is not currently handled correctly.
 *
 * In practice, we've seen only one situation that triggered the problem: a Python
 * task that ran the Java VM required close to the 20 threads allocated a
 * Python task at the time, and a second concurrent test would fail. For now
 * this problem has been resolved by increasing the allocation of processes
 * to 200, but a better solution is needed in the longer term.
 * 
 * The problem has been solved in the Jobe sandbox, which is one of the many reasons
 * the runguardsandbox class is now deprecated.
